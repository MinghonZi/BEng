\subsection{Conclusion}

In this assignment, a electronic safe system was designed with top-down methodology. Detailed module representations include block diagrams, ASM charts, verilog code, and simulated waveforms are presented. Modules were tested by exhausting paths of their ASM chart, and the simulation test results were explained. The full system was tested by the sepecified use case in both the board and the simulator, and the corresponding simulation test results were also explained.
