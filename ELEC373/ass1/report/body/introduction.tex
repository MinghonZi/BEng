\section{Introduction}

This assignment is to design an electronic safe and implement it on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board by descripting its logic with a hardware description language (HDL) and synthesising the circuit with an electronic design automation (EDA) tool.

During the design and implementation process, students will learn two visualisation techniques and one methodology to help with design: algorithmic state machine (ASM) chart, block diagram, and top-down design, and will also become familiar with three development tools for FPGA implementation: Verilog 2005 which is a HDL whose descendant is SystemVerilog, Quartus II which is the last EDA tool supports Altera DE2 board, and a HDL simulator, ModelSim HDL simulator, which is a standalone software but can be used with other EDA tools includes Quartus II.

The remainder of the report is organised as follows: Section 2 demostrates the architecture of the electronic safe. Section 3 lists all aforementioned modules each with detailed description includes ASM chart, Verilog code, and simulation results with annotations.
