\section{Background}

Computer vision is an important tool for mobile robots to perceive the surrounding environment. Unlike humans, however, the images captured by cameras need to be processed before they can be understood by robots, which requires the use of image processing techniques.

This assignment explores the basic tools of image processing with OpenCV 4.2 and C++.
