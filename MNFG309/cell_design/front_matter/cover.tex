\parbox{0.85\textwidth}{
   This technical report presents a proposal for automating the injection moulded crate manufacturing process in order to reduce labour costs, enhance productivity, and ensure compliance with health and safety legislation. The proposed robotic work cell comprises an existing injection moulding machine, a robotic arm, a die flash removal station, a stacking and transport system, safety equipment, and a control system. The limitations and future improvements of the design are discussed in the text.
